# TextNow-Chat-App
Sample chat app using Swift and Firebase

Sending messages works, but chat bubbles still need to be implemented

To use this app:
1. Download the project file
2. Open it in Xcode and run it on the simulator
3. Create an account and you can now send messages to any other created accounts
